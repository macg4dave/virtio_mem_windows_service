//! Shared-pool bookkeeping across VMs, as a pure function of one round's inputs.
//!
//! The pool only tracks how much of `pool_bytes` is free and who gets it first.
//! It never takes memory away: releasing and requesting memory are decided by
//! each VM's own controller. A member's charge is `max(requested, current)`,
//! so memory a guest is still giving back stays charged until its `current`
//! drops, and a crashed VM keeps its charge until it releases the memory.
//! No pool state is persisted; every round is recomputed from the charges.
