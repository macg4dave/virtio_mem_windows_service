# Testing Strategy

## Local Testing

All testing is performed locally. No CI pipeline is currently configured.

### Rust Service Testing

```bash
cd windows
cargo build --release
cargo test
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo fmt --all
```

The Rust service tests should cover QGA response parsing, threshold boundaries, minimum/maximum safe ranges, and invalid configuration cases. They do not require a live VM.

### Real VM validation

On the RHEL host, validate the Windows guest agent and live device before enabling automatic updates:

1. Confirm `guest-info` and `guest-get-memory-stats` succeed three times.
2. Capture the virtio-mem alias, block size, `requested`, and `current` values from live XML.
3. Perform one reversible aligned live resize manually.
4. Confirm `current` converges before testing another request.
5. Test guest-agent interruption, guest reboot, failed update, and service restart.

### Bash validation helpers

- Run focused shell validation scripts locally before use on a target host.
- Check for required environment variables and host tooling early.
- Prefer explicit error handling and exit codes over silent fallback behavior.
