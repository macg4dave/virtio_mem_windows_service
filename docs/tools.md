Metrics loads the host list and its sibling settings files. It reads the built-in
guest control publication over QGA; optional telemetry paths can be omitted.

`Watch-Ram.ps1` reads Windows memory directly with `GetPerformanceInfo`. It
does not load configuration or require the service or telemetry output.

The Windows deployment helper also provisions access to the optional
`org.virtio-mem.wake.0` serial port for LocalService. It saves the previous device
security property with the deployment backup; a missing port retains polling.
See [the deployment guide](../deploy/config_files/README.md#prompt-memory-notifications)
for the VM channel and host group requirements. RAM growth requests cover the
calculated shortage; reclaim uses a 1-second continuous history window.

Metrics captures include `run.json` provenance and `guest-publications.jsonl`
state-change/30-second snapshots. CSV includes guest policy explanations;
sustained performance problems produce incident bundles alongside crashes.
See [capture diagnostics](../deploy/config_files/README.md#diagnostic-evidence-in-metrics-captures).
